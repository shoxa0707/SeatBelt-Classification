## Introduction

Many of us forget or don't want to wear a seatbelt when we drive. This, in turn, is very dangerous for life. Because of this, it is necessary to check whether driver is wearing a seat belt or not. Our following project will help with this.<br>

In addition to classifying whether or not driver is wearing a seatbelt, the program also uses [image super resolution](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN). This, in turn, increases the accuracy of determining whether the driver has violated the rule or not.

### Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. Itâ€™s all Python, open-source, and free! And once youâ€™ve created an app you can use our Community Cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share your app.

You can run following command to use streamlit in our case:

```bash
  streamlit run stream.py
```

The result is as follows:

## âš¡ Quick Inference

### Python script

```console
  Usage: python inference.py -t tensorflow -m models/seatbelt.model -i some.png -d cpu [options]...

  A common command: python inference.py -i some.png

    -t --type                Usage type. Options: tensorflow | pytorch. Default: tensorflow
    -m --model               Model path. Model path must match the type. Default: models/seatbelt.model
    -i --image               Image for classification. Options: auto | jpg | png.
    -d --device              Inference device. If you have GPU, you can use it. Options: cpu | gpu. Default: cpu
```

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 2
- Tensorflow >= 2.8

  ### Installation

  1. Clone repo

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shoxa0707/SeatBelt-Classification.git
     cd SeatBelt-Classification
     ```

  1. Install dependent packages

     ```bash
     # if you have a GPU, install as follows:
     pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.8
     pip install torch==2.0.0+cu118 torchvision==0.15.1+cu118 torchaudio==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118(sample for CUDA 11.8)
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     # else
     pip install tensorflow==2.8
     pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 torchaudio==2.0.1
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## ðŸ’» Train

There are usually two ways to train classification.

1. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
2. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

### Tensorflow

Tensorflow has a special place in training deep learning models and in particular in image classification. In our case, the tensorflow trained model achieved ~80% accuracy.

```console
  Usage: python train_tensorflow.py -d Data -b 16 -e 100 -s models/seatbelt.model --res [options]...

  A common command: python train_tensorflow.py -d Data -s mdoel.model --res

    -d --dataset                  Dataset path. Default: Data
    -b --batch_size               Training batch size. Default: 16
    -e --epochs                   Training epochs. Default: 100
    -s --save                     Save path trained model. Default: models/seatbelt.model
    --res                         Using resolution for dataset images.
    --no-res                      Don't using resolution for dataset images.
```

### Pytorch

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

In our case, the pytorch trained model achieved ~60% accuracy.

```console
  Usage: python train_pytorch.py -d Data -b 16 -e 100 -s models/seatbelt.model --res [options]...

  A common command: python train_pytorch.py -d Data -s model.pt

    -d --dataset                  Dataset path. Default: Data
    -c --device                   Training device. Options: cpu | cuda. default: cpu
    -b --batch_size               Training batch size. Default: 16
    -e --epochs                   Training epochs. Default: 100
    -s --save                     Save path trained model. Default: models/seatbelt.pt
```

Where dataset path should be:

```bash
dataset path
    -- train
        -- Aniqlanmadi
        -- Taqilgan
        -- Taqilmagan
    -- test
        -- Aniqlanmadi
        -- Taqilgan
        -- Taqilmagan
```
